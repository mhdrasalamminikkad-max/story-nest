Create a fully responsive, unique, child-friendly storytelling WEBSITE called “StoryNest”.

🎯 Purpose:
Help parents easily find bedtime stories and help children build reading habits safely online.

🧸 Design Concept:
The entire site should feel like a cozy, animated bedtime world — with clouds, stars, books, and moonlight themes. 
Design it for desktop and mobile browsers, not as an app.

🎨 Design Requirements:
- Use soft pastel gradients (lavender, sky blue, cream yellow, pink mist).
- Add floating animated clouds and stars (CSS + Framer Motion).
- Use big rounded buttons and cards (border-radius: 2xl).
- Font combo: “Fredoka One” for headings, “Poppins” for body text.
- Gentle shadows, dreamy transitions, subtle glow effects.
- Illustrations should look friendly and safe (storybook-style).
- Include a toggle for “Day Mode” (sunrise colors) and “Night Mode” (dark blue + stars).

🧩 Website Structure:

1️⃣ Home Page:
   - Hero section with tagline: “Stories that grow with your child.”
   - Buttons: “Parent Login / Sign Up” and “Explore Stories”.
   - Animated background (floating stars, moon).
   - Section previewing a few stories with cute thumbnails.

2️⃣ After Login/Signup:
   - Redirect to **Child Lock Setup Page**
     - Field to set Parent PIN (4 digits)
     - Choose reading time limit (10–60 min)
     - Option to enable fullscreen lock
     - Save settings → Go to Dashboard

3️⃣ Parent Dashboard:
   - Show all available stories in cards (title, image, short summary)
   - Options: Add New Story, Bookmark Story, Activate Child Mode
   - Button: “Go to Child Mode”

4️⃣ Child Mode (Fullscreen Web Mode):
   - Fullscreen view (using JavaScript Fullscreen API)
   - Show one story at a time (title, image, text)
   - “Read Aloud” button (use Web Speech API for narration)
   - Cute animations (stars twinkle while reading)
   - “Exit” button opens Parent PIN dialog to unlock and exit.
   - Disable ESC / Alt+Tab / Back navigation during reading (lock mode simulation)

5️⃣ Footer:
   - Soft gradient footer with moon + stars icon
   - Credits: “Made with 💛 for dreamers and readers.”

⚙️ Technical Setup:
- Framework: React + Vite (for fast loading)
- Styling: TailwindCSS + Framer Motion
- Auth & DB: Firebase Authentication + Firestore
- Child Lock: Use Fullscreen API + Wake Lock API (web only)
- Narration: Web Speech API
- Hosting: Any web host (Firebase Hosting / Render / Netlify)

📱 Responsiveness:
- Mobile-first layout that adapts perfectly to tablets & browsers
- Smooth animations but light on performance
- No app download — runs entirely as a website.

💫 Goal:
A magical, storybook-style website that parents trust and children love to explore — not a boring web app. 
Every element should feel alive, warm, and built with imagination.
